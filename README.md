### Problem Category: Environment & Health

### Pitch:

The objective for this project is to create visualizations showing the status of air pollution within the US statewide. Our time series visualizations are dependent on elements that form air-particles/compounds. This interactive map allows users to adjust a slide-bar throughout a range of 0 to 1, representing the percentages of intensity. MAPredict also allows users to examine potential future states of pollution. MAPredict is a way to get a glimpse of the foreseeable future. Our mission is to showcase this information to users with the initiative that it will help them reconsider how they can help reduce the impact of pollution in their areas.
